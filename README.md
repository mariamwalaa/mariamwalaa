## Mariam's Data Science Portfolio

I am data scientist with a passion for solving real-world problems using machine learning and data-driven insights, contributing to a range of projects that have made a significant impact. I have over 6 years of experience leading end-to-end data science projects and building production-ready predictive models in technology/software, retail, and CPG. Details are in my [resume](https://github.com/mariamwalaa/mariamwalaa/blob/main/MariamWalaa_Resume.pdf).

## Education

- üéì I hold Master of Science in Applied Mathematics from Toronto Metropolitan University, with my thesis focus at the intersection of Network Science and Machine Learning.

- üéì I also hold an Honours Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, with minors in Statistics & Geographic Information Science, from the University of Toronto, which I completed in April 2023.

- üéì In addition, I previously started a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) from the Schulich School of Business at York University, which I departed in 2017.

- üåê I am an *Expert* in Python (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib) for data science and machine learning, and *Intermediate* in SQL (able to manipulate and analyze complex, large-scale datasets).

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
